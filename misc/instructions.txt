Hey developers, I have a new task for you! A regular customer has requested a provisional version for one of his latest projects: a bookstore. At the moment it does not need to be an actual store but later on it will be. We just need to show the books on screen, preferably with a search bar. These are the requested requirements:
The technologies used will be: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
To achieve the flip card effect, you can either use pure CSS or use the library FancyBox (find links below). If you have not worked with them, take a look. 
The project must be finished IN TWO DAYS because he will ask me to show it to him.
The books data are hosted on a remote JSON. You must access without downloading it since the client can modify the content without modifying the structure and the project should work without touching anything on the web page.
Books should be displayed with a little responsive behaviour. No need to fight with media queries, only a little adaptation with Bootstrap or plain flexbox would be enough.
(OPTIONAL) It would be interesting to include a search engine to search for any field in the book. Whether it be title, description or any other.
The logo (look for one in the web) should be on the top left and the search field (optional) on the top right.
When doing HOVER on each of the covers, it must be rotated to show the title, the description and a “More Info” button (This effect is just CSS. Google is your friend). This button will take you to a more detailed image (“detalle” in the json) of the cover (not the same image) that should be shown in a LIGHTBOX (popup/modal) and NOT in another website (use FancyBox).

P.S - The customer just sent me a video with a possible solution. You decide if you want to make it look like this. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7MuB9FR6W82MF9rVFI4QTlvVmc/view
